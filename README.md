Decision Tree Classifier on Bank Dataset
Overview
This project involves applying a Decision Tree Classifier to a bank dataset to predict customer outcomes and gain insights into customer behavior. The analysis aims to build a predictive model that can classify bank customers based on various features, providing valuable insights into customer characteristics and behaviors.

Analysis Components
Data Preparation

Initial exploration and preprocessing of the bank dataset, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and splitting the data into training and test sets.
Decision Tree Classification

Implementation of a Decision Tree Classifier to predict customer outcomes such as loan approval or account type based on features such as age, balance, and job role.
Evaluation of the model’s performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Model Interpretation

Visualization of the decision tree to understand how decisions are made based on different features.
Analysis of feature importance to identify which factors most influence the predictions.
Data Source
The dataset used in this project is a commonly used dataset for classification tasks, often available from various data repositories or as part of machine learning competitions. It contains information about bank customers, including demographic details, account information, and financial behaviors.

Insights
Feature Importance: The analysis reveals which features are most influential in predicting customer outcomes, providing insights into customer behavior and preferences.
Model Performance: The decision tree classifier’s performance metrics indicate how well the model classifies customer outcomes, and the visualization helps in understanding the decision-making process.
Explore this project to see how decision tree classification can be applied to bank data and how it can be used to gain insights into customer behavior and decision-making.
